This directory contains files used in the Bmad/Tao tutorial.

The easiest way to access the tutorial is from Bmad web site:
	  www.lepp.cornell.edu/bmad
Click on either the "Bmad Manual" or "Tao Manual" link and there should be a link to download the tutorial.

Lattice files are in the subdirectory:
		lattice_files

In case you are interested, the LaTeX source files to generate the tutorial PDF are in the directory:
		doc
But the pdf is posted on the web (see above) so the LaTeX source files will not be of general interest.
